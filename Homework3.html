    <h2>Have European countries made a mistake in halting AstraZeneca shots? Here's what health experts say</h2>
    <p>Within the space of a few days, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has ground to a standstill in virtually all of western Europe.</p>
    <p>France, Spain, Germany, Italy and more than a dozen other countries have paused rollout of the shot, calling it a precautionary measure following concerns that it could be linked to blood clots; decisions that go against the advice of global health agencies.</p>
    <p>And given the advantage of hindsight, the latest intelligence assessment is not just an isolated example of incriminating evidence against Russia and its efforts to create chaos and discord within the United States.</p>

    <h2>US has assessed North Korea could be preparing to carry out first weapons test since Biden took office</h2>
    <p>US intelligence has assessed that North Korea could be preparing to carry out their first weapons test since President Joe Biden came into office, according to several US officials speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The real bombshell it contains is not the confidence of the spy agencies that Russia hoped to subvert American democracy. It is that US intelligence experts effectively confirmed that for the second election in a row, Trump acolytes repeatedly used, knowingly or otherwise, misinformation produced by the spies of one of America's most sworn foreign adversaries to try to win a US election.</p>
    <p>Thus, the candidate who Moscow helped to win the 2016 election had four years later become the primary destructive force aimed at US democracy.</p>
